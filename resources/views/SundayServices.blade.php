<h1>Sunday Services</h1>
<p>As a whole church we come together every Sunday to worship God, to grow together as God’s family, and to share our lives. We meet both in the morning at 11:00 and again at 18:30. The services last around 1 to 1.5 hrs.</p>
<p>At both services our worship group lead us in a time of worship through song and prayer. Led by a member of the church or a guest speaker we then spend time looking into the Bible, to study and understand God’s practical guidance for our lives.</p>
<p>For the little ones we have a 3 and under soft play area just for them. This is in a corner of the main church building so you are not far, but is supervised so you can relax and enjoy the services.</p>
<p>All evening services are followed by tea, coffee and biscuits (sometimes cakes)!</p>
<p>Please phone 07783 334014 or  {!! Html::mailto('info@wefc.church?subject=Sunday Services','email us') !!} to ask about the details of any particular Sunday. <p>
