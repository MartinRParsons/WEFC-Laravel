<h1>Sunday Services</h1>
<h2>Morning and evening</h2>
<p>As a whole church we come together every Sunday to worship God, to grow together as God’s family, and to share our lives. We meet both in the morning at 11:00 and again at 18:30. The services last around an hour</p>
<p>At both services our worship group lead us in a time of worship through song and prayer. Led by a member of the church or a guest speaker we then spend time looking into the Bible, to study and understand God’s practical guidance for our lives.</p>
<p>For the little ones we have a 3 and under soft play area just for them. This is in a corner of the main church building so you are not far, but is supervised so you can relax and enjoy the services.</p>
<p>All evening services are followed by tea, coffee and biscuits (sometimes cakes)!</p>
<p>Please phone 07783 334014 or  {!! Html::mailto('info@wefc.church?subject=Sunday Services','email us') !!} to ask about the details of any particular Sunday. <p>

<h2>Communion</h2>
<p>Twice a month we celebrate Communion together after the service. Led by one of the church Elders or Deacons we remember Jesus' command to his disciples at the Last Supper to remember him in this way. Breaking bread and sharing wine together we remember Jesus' death and resurection, thanking him for what he did for us on the cross and looking forward to his return.</p>
