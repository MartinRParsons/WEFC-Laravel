<h1>Friday Club</h1>
<h2>When?</h2>
<p>7:30 â€“ 9:00</p>
<h2>Where? </h2>
<p>Hall @ WEFC</p>
<h2>Who?</h2>
<p>For secondary aged young people, age 11 and up.</p>
<h3>The Team:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Alex Parkes</li>
  <li>Kirstie Parkes</li>
  <li>Martin Parsons</li>
  <li>Danny Driscoll</li>
  <li>David Lomas</li>
  <li>Leo Beaumont</li>
  <li>Anchen Joubert</li>
  <li>Alice Hopkins</li>
</ul>
<h2>What?</h2>
<h3>Games</h3>
<p>We play typical sports games such as football, hockey and basketball. As well as more specialist games, for example obstacle courses and nerf target games.</p>
<h3>Other activities</h3>
<p>We also have different activities every so often such as debates, creating radio programmes and first aid training</p>
<h3>Bible discussion</h3>
<p>
Each week a different subject, bible passage or influential person will be presented to the young people with the option for them to ask questions. As a team we aim to choose subjects that will directly apply to their daily lives and will help them in some way.</p>
<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>We run our Friday club to give young people from the area the opportunity and environment to have fun and socialise outside of school. The bible discussion time gives them the chance to open up and receive to support from young adults on the team who have been through similar challenges, for example, GCSES.</p>
