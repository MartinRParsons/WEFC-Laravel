<h1>Bible Study and Prayer Meeting</h1>
<p>We meet every Tuesday at 8:00pm to 9:30pm to pray together, study the Bible, and have fellowship. We have a huge heart for the world at WEFC and for people, particularly when people go through difficult times and heartaches. We love to pray and lift people and nations before God and welcome any who would like to come and join with us and pray for a world in so desperate need of Jesus Christâ€™s Love and salvation. We also have a passion for the word of God and love to study it together. So, if you want to understand the Bible more, please come and join with us on Tuesday evenings. We meet at the church, entrance through the side door on Balliol Road.</p>
