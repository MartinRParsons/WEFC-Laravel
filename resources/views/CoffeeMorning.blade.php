  <h1>Coffee Morning</h1>
  <p>Every Thursday during term time we host a coffee morning from 10:30 at WEFC serving hot and cold drinks and biscuits.</p>
  <p>With tables to chat or play games, as well as a soft play area for under 3's there is something for everyone.</p>
  <p>If you've ever wanted an opportunity to ask us about what we beleive as Christians at WEFC then this is a great place to have an informal chat with some of our members.</p>
  <p>We have pastoral care available if you need to talk to someone about issues such as sickness, grief or any other struggles you might be having. We have resources avaialable to point you in the direction of other organisations who may be better placed in meeting your needs.</p>
