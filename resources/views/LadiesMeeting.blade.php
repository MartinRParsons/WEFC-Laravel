  <h1>Ladies Meeting</h1>
  <p>Our meeting is open to ladies of all ages, meeting usually in the church kitchen for an hour from 14:00 each Thursday afternoon during school term time. </p>
  <p>Our aim is to encourage each other, support each other when life gets tough (and it does at times), to share what the Bible teaches in a way that relates to us so we can see how God understands and can give direction and help. </p>
  <p>Prayer is also important to us, as we pray for each other and situations both close and far from home. All are free to pray or join in silently.</p>
  <p>We also like singing and praising God, it lifts up our hearts. You don't have to be good at it, some of us aren't!</p>
  <p>We have a varied programme from our usual Bible study, prayer and praise; to visiting folk who like our company and cheery faces; to having a visiting speaker who might share what they do, for example, a practise nurse speaking about women's health, a lady giving us a cake decorating lesson for Christmas and also someone speaking on fostering children and what that involves. </p>
  <p>Then there are our outings, usually at the end of term but not always. We have been to Ruxley garden centre, Trossley Park and Hall Place, to name but a few.</p>
  <p>Our aim as a group of ladies is to be a blessing to each other.</p>
