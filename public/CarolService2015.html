    <h2>SHEPHERD - BOB/MARTIN</h2>
    <p>Welcome to our Carols by candlelight service. Tonight we celebrate the single most joyous event in all of history - the birth of our Saviour  . . . Jesus Christ. This Christmas, in order to remember really well, the gift God sent some 2,015 years ago, we'd like to share the Christmas story through the eyes of those closest to the events, like me, one of the shepherds. And to sing with gusto, some of the greatest Christmas carols of the Christian faith which recall those events. Welcome - to the sights and sounds of Christmas past!</p>

    <h2>WISE MAN - KEN/KIRSTIE  </h2>
    <p>Phew, we are being spared the smells of Christmas past - although that Camel still stinks! Welcome everyone, as we celebrate what happened on the first Christmas all those years ago. BUT . . . there were those long before . . . who longed for this babies arrival. The announcement of Christ's birth first started with a promise from God and then, the anticipation rose in the heart of Israel. The Christ was first prophesied to Israel when much of the nation, were slaves in Babylonian captivity. For centuries after the prophecy they waited expectantly for the Messiah that would ransom them and set them free.</p>

  <div class="narrator1">
    <h2>NARRATOR 1 - JOHN</h2>
    <p>The Christmas Carol "O Come, O Come Emmanuel" speaks fervently of this longing. Christ is our Emmanuel-deliverer. The "Rod of Jesse," "Dayspring," and "Key of David" are all Old Testament prophetic references to the coming birth of The Christ. The Christ, Emmanuel, translates as "God with us", and He is even now, with us in all things.</p>
    <p>As the people of Israel waited for the coming Messiah, the coming of Jesus Christ, so too we are able to remember, and await for Christ's second return.</p>

    <h2>NARRATOR 2 - ANCHEN</h2>
    <p>This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit. Because Joseph her husband was a righteous man and did not want to expose her to public disgrace, he had in mind to divorce her quietly. (Joseph enter when narrator says "because Joseph her husband...)</p>

    <h2>JOSEPH MONOLOGUE 1 - ALEX/ ALICE</h2>
    <p>When I first heard about the baby I was angry . . . angry at Mary for getting herself pregnant, angry at God for allowing it to happen, angry at myself for being tangled up in the mess of a pregnancy scandal.  I couldn't give Mary away - it would be the end of her reputation and maybe even her life.  But choosing silence implicated me in her pregnancy and the disgrace I would bring to my own good name was more than I could bear.  I made up my mind to quietly divorce her.  It was the only scenario I thought would give each of us any hope for the future.  I would not openly accuse her, but I could not claim her child as mine.</p>
    <p>Then one night an angel appeared to me in a dream.  He told me not to be afraid to marry her - that Mary was in fact telling me the truth, and that her child was God's Son.  Everything changed.  I understood that God had chosen my fiancé to carry the Promised Messiah . . . and that He had chosen me to be His earthly father.</p>

    <h2>INN KEEPER - BOB/KIRSTIE</h2>
    <p>I was the Inn Keeper in Bethlehem, you know, where Mary and Joseph stayed - boy was she pregnant! They had travelled a long way cos Caesar Augustus, issued a decree that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world. Everyone had to go to their own town of origin in order to register. Joseph had to travel from where he was living in the town of Nazareth in Galilee all the way to Judea, to Bethlehem the town of David, because he belonged to the house and line of David. What dreadful timing! Having to travel miles with a pregnant wife! When they arrived in Bethlehem, Mary was ready to pop. They tried getting a place at all the local inns but everything was full. When they came knocking at my door, I offered them the only space I had - the stable out the back, and so that is where Mary gave birth to her firstborn, a son. I saw her wrap him in cloths and place him in the manger, which is what the animals eat out of. Seriously, I felt really bad, but there was just no room anywhere else!</p>

    <h2>NARRATOR 2 - ANCHEN </h2>
    <p>"O Little Town of Bethlehem" was written by Philip Brooks in 1868 three years after he returned from a trip to the Holy Land. When the Children's choir needed a Christmas song for their Sunday School Christmas program he quickly wrote the lyrics inspired by his visit to Bethlehem and gave them to his organist. The day before the Christmas program, the song was completed.</p>

    <p>For thousands of years I have delivered God's messages to earth.  At times what He speaks is personal and intimate.  Other times His voice is mighty and strong to be heard by any who choose to listen and change.  Every time His words are exact, true, perfect.  When the Maker of heaven and earth takes a moment to speak . . . it is more wonderful and beautiful than any being could possibly express. This message which I bought to Mary, to Joseph, to the Shepherds. This is the Message that heralds every other message I have ever delivered: God wearing the flesh of humanity as a child born to save the world.</p>

    <p>Mary was an incredible person. She was chosen by God to do something no woman before or since has ever been called to do - bear and raise the only Son of God. Looking back at the message I delivered that night; what I said seems like an impossible feat.</p>
    <p class="stagenote">(Narrator pause/ angel address Mary)</p>
    <p>"Do not be afraid, Mary, you have found favor with God. You will be with child and give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus. He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David, and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever; his kingdom will never end."</p>

    <p>Sometimes I wonder what it would have been like to stand in Bethlehem the night that Jesus was born. I wonder what stories the stars would have told, what sound the Angels would have cried, and what earthly presence would have been in the manger.</p>
    <p>I can't help but believe there had to have been something different in the air - something that made people question what sacred thing had just transpired. I suspect that many people in Bethlehem missed it. But some were allowed to know, and feel, and sense, supernaturally, the weight of Jesus' entrance into humanity. And while they probably did not understand every intricate detail of God's plan, they knew that night was different, they knew that night was special, and they knew that night was holy.</p>

    <p>As we neared Mary's delivery, we were alone in a new city with no place to stay.  I tried to be brave for Mary's sake but I was lost in my own fear.  I'd never delivered a baby before and I wanted so desperately for everything to be right.  And then Jesus came into the world perfect and beautiful and screaming at the top of his lungs.  It was the greatest moment of my life . . . possibly the greatest moment of all time . . . and the world became right.</p>

    <p>You might not know but shepherds are not the most popular guys in town and we've learnt to keep ourselves to ourselves but that night we hurried off and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby, lying in the manger just as the angel said. We praised God! And told the young couple all that we had seen and heard, then we told everyone we met on the way home and they were amazed. I felt so privileged to see such a sight and meet my saviour.</p>

    <p>It is more than a birthday we celebrate. We celebrate the beginnings of our freedom, the beginnings of our salvation, the beginnings of a heavenly kingdom that He will rule and reign. We celebrate the purpose of His coming - His death on the cross and the purchase that was made for our right-standing with God - and we celebrate His victory over the human condition, over death, over all things that attempt to enslave and bind us.</p>
    <p>It is more than the methods of our celebration - the gifts and family that we hold dear. Christmas is so much greater a celebration. If we can grasp the immensity of the gift that we've been given we can really identify with the meaning of Christmas, and it will change our lives for all eternity.</p>
